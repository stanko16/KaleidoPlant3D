# KaleidoPlant3D
<h3>L-Systems applied using Java and Processing </h3>
Lindenmayer systems are used to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals such as iterated function systems.<br>
This program developed in Java with the Processing libraries lets the user change not only the growth rules of the systems, but also the colors, the angles of the branches and enables the user to use the mouse to drag the 3D figure around to have a 360Â° view of it.<br>
